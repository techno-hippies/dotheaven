# AA Gateway (ERC-4337 Account Abstraction)
- **Service**: `services/aa-gateway/` — Bun HTTP server that validates UserOps and sponsors gas via a VerifyingPaymaster
- **Alto bundler**: `services/alto/` — Pimlico's ERC-4337 bundler (git submodule), submits UserOps to EntryPoint
- **Deployed on EigenCloud TEE**: App ID `0xF2E275a9A27C1bc684f7d546100687601111Dec4`, IP `34.168.65.48`
- **Current URL**: `http://34.168.65.48:3337` (TLS pending — see quirks below)
- **TLS URL (when working)**: `https://34-168-65-48.nip.io`
- **Docker image**: `t3333333k/heaven-aa:latest` on Docker Hub
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health` → `{"ok":true,"chainId":6343}`
  - `POST /quotePaymaster` — validates unsigned UserOp, returns `paymasterAndData`
  - `POST /sendUserOp` — re-validates signed UserOp, unpacks v0.7 packed fields, forwards to Alto bundler
- **Two-step handshake**: Frontend builds UserOp → `/quotePaymaster` returns paymaster signature → PKP signs `userOpHash` → `/sendUserOp` forwards to bundler
- **Target allowlist**: Only ScrobbleV4 (`scrobbleBatch`, `registerAndScrobbleBatch`) — enforced in `validation.ts`
- **Gas caps**: `callGasLimit=5M`, `verificationGasLimit=3M`, `preVerificationGas=500K` (generous for MegaEVM)
- **Local dev**: `bash services/aa-gateway/start.sh` (auto-loads `.env`, starts Alto + gateway)
- **Docker build** (from repo root):
  ```bash
  docker build -f services/aa-gateway/Dockerfile \
    --build-context alto=services/alto \
    --build-context gateway=services/aa-gateway \
    -t heaven-aa .
  ```
- **Deploy to EigenCloud**: `docker tag heaven-aa t3333333k/heaven-aa:latest && docker push t3333333k/heaven-aa:latest`, then `ecloud compute app upgrade <app-id>` (interactive — requires TTY)
- **EigenCloud quirks**:
  - `ecloud` CLI has interactive prompts (inquirer.js) that can't be bypassed with flags — user must run deploy/upgrade manually
  - Port exposure requires TLS via Caddy — EigenCloud firewalls all ports unless TLS is configured
  - `ecloud compute app configure tls` generates Caddyfile + TLS env vars (local scaffolding only — doesn't affect deployed app)
  - `app start` restarts with existing image; `app upgrade` pulls new image from registry
  - nip.io wildcard DNS used for Let's Encrypt certs on raw IPs (e.g. `34-168-65-48.nip.io`)
  - `DOMAIN` in `.env` MUST match the assigned IP — if EigenCloud assigns a new IP on redeploy, update `DOMAIN` before upgrading
  - Switching from staging to production LE certs requires a fresh deploy (terminate + deploy) — `upgrade` reuses cached certs
  - Container startup must be fast — Caddy health checks failing at startup can cause the TEE launcher to terminate the container. Gateway starts immediately alongside Alto (not sequentially) so `/health` responds right away.
  - Caddyfile should NOT have active health checks on the reverse_proxy — they cause startup race conditions
  - Staging certs (`ACME_STAGING=true`) work for TLS but aren't trusted by browsers; switch to `false` for production
  - **TLS provisioning bug (Feb 2026)**: After terminate+redeploy, EigenCloud may fail to inject the `tls-keygen` binary. Logs show `TLS not configured (no tls-keygen binary)`. This is a platform-side issue — ticket opened with EigenLayer team. Workaround: use HTTP on port 3337 directly (works for dev/testnet, not for production web clients due to mixed-content blocking)
  - **Env file on upgrade**: Always select "Enter path to existing env file" when upgrading to ensure DOMAIN/APP_PORT/TLS vars are injected into KMS. Without this, TLS won't be provisioned even if the Caddyfile is in the image.
- **Key files**:
  - `services/aa-gateway/src/index.ts` — HTTP server (Bun.serve)
  - `services/aa-gateway/src/config.ts` — env var config + target allowlist
  - `services/aa-gateway/src/validation.ts` — UserOp policy checks (factory, calldata, gas caps, implementation slot)
  - `services/aa-gateway/src/paymaster.ts` — VerifyingPaymaster hash + signature
  - `services/aa-gateway/start.sh` — startup script (auto-detects Docker vs local dev)
  - `services/aa-gateway/Dockerfile` — multi-stage build (Foundry → Alto TS → Runtime)
  - `services/aa-gateway/Caddyfile` — Caddy reverse proxy config for EigenCloud TLS
  - `services/aa-gateway/.env` — config (keys, contracts, TLS vars)
  - `apps/frontend/src/lib/aa-client.ts` — frontend AA client (builds UserOps, calls gateway)
