# Packages

Shared TypeScript packages used by product apps.

## Directories
- `core/` — business logic and shared domain utilities.
- `i18n/` — localization data/helpers.
- `platform/` — platform-specific adapters.
- `ui/` — reusable UI components and Storybook.

## Typical Workflow
- Edit package code.
- Run checks from repo root: `bun check`.
